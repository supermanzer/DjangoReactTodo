# DjangoReact - Todo
---
This project is my first attempt at building out a full stack application
utilizing the React front-end framework as well as the Django Rest
Framework.  Previous work with the Django web framework has
been very productive and so this seemed like a natural extension
of that knowledge.


I a borrowing the bulk of this code from the excellent tutorial from [Django For Beginners](https://djangoforbeginners.com/todo-list-api/).  The one major difference in my approach is to use docker-compose to build a network of front-end and back-end containers, each of which could be scaled up depending on usage.
